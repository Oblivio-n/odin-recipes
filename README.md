# odin-recipes
My first html project!
Thanks TOP!
Jai Shree Ram!

Before this, I have created two very simple html based websites, now I will try to make
a proper html based website on the topic of 'recipes'
I will try my best to make it as good as possible
I will be able to demonstrate my basic understanding of html, the boilerplate, the elements and the attributes
