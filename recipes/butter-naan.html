            <h3>Make dough</h3>
            <li>To a mixing bowl add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar and grated garlic.</li>
            <li>Pour yogurt, oil and 4 tps luke warm milk. Begin to mix to form a smooth dough adding more warm milk as needed. You may need
                up to half cup milk.
            </li>
            <li>Knead well until the dough turns soft, elastic and pliable. Wehen you press down the dough with your finger, it should dent easily.</li>
            <li>Optionally you can cover and rest the dough for 1 to 2 hours in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Grease your fingers with ghee or oil and divide the dough to 6 to 8 parts depending on the size you prefer.</li>
            <li>Make smooth balls and keep them covered until you finish rolling the naans.</li>

            <h3>How to make Naan</h3>
            <li>Sprinkle little flour on the rolling area and place a dough ball.</li>
            <li>Roll the ball to 8 to 9 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide depending on the size the dough ball.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle kalonji seeds, sliced garlic and coriander leaves. Press down or roll gently.</li>
            <li>When you are done with 5 to 6 naans, begin to heat a griddle or pan.</li>
            <li>Ensure the pan is hot enough, then transfer the naan to it. Within a minute or so bubbles will be visible on top.</li>
            <li>With the help of a tong, flip it and cook either on the pan or diretly over the gas fire or stove. Or place a wired rack on the 
                stove and toast it.
            </li>
            <li>When you see brown spots on the naan, remove them to a plate and brush with some butter. Ensure it is cooked through on both the sides well.</li>
            <li>Smear some butter on top and serve naan right away with kadhai paneer or any other curry.</li>
